1)    What is the purpose of hashCode() 
2)    What is the purpose of toString()
3)    What is constructor and what are types of constructors
4)    Explain about enum in detail
5)    What is the difference between interface and abstract class, explain practically



1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.   	        Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	                        Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	                Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	                The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.	An interface can extend another Java interface only.






A toString() is an in-built method in Java that returns the value given to it in string format. Hence, any object that this method is applied on, will then be returned as a string object.
